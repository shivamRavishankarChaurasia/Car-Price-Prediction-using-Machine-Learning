🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting the resale price of cars using various features like brand, model, mileage, fuel type, engine power, etc. The dataset was scraped from CarDekho, a leading car marketplace in India. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression algorithms, this project aims to build a robust and accurate model to assist buyers and sellers in estimating a car's market value.

🧠 Problem Statement
Accurately determining the resale value of a used car is crucial for both car buyers and sellers. Traditional estimations may be biased or uninformed. Hence, this project aims to build a machine learning regression model that predicts the selling price of a car based on various technical and categorical features.

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple car listings with the following columns:

Feature	Description
car_name	Full name of the car (used for EDA, dropped for modeling)
brand	Car brand (e.g., Maruti, Hyundai, Ford)
model	Car model (e.g., Alto, i20, Ecosport)
vehicle_age	Age of the car in years
km_driven	Kilometers driven
seller_type	Type of seller - Individual or Dealer
fuel_type	Fuel type - Petrol, Diesel, CNG
transmission_type	Transmission - Manual or Automatic
mileage	Fuel efficiency in km/l
engine	Engine capacity in cc
max_power	Maximum power output in bhp
seats	Number of seats
selling_price	Target variable - Price of the car (in INR)
